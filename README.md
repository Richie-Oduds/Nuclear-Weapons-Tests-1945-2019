# INTRODUCTION
According to wikipedia nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine nuclear weapons' effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability. Testing nuclear weapons offers practical information about how the weapons function, how detonations are affected by different conditions, and how personnel, structures, and equipment are affected when subjected to nuclear explosions. However, nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength. Many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status through a nuclear test.

### ABOUT THE DATA

This data was collected from https://www.kaggle.com, The data shows the year of each nuclear test by their country. The dataset is reliable, original and comprehensive. The source has their own licence over the dataset. Besides that, the dataset doesn't have any personal information. All the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data. Finally, It would be good to have some updated information about the nuclear weapons tests.

### Question(s) for Analysis

The following are a list of questions to be answered after carefully studying the dataset:

1. Country with the highest nuclear weapons tests from 1945-2019
2. Country with the lowest nuclear weapons tests from 1945-2019
3. Country with the highest nuclear weapon test in a calendar year
4. Country with the lowest nuclear weapon test in a calendar year
5. Percentage of nuclear weapons tests by countries using a pie chart
6. Countries that has tested nuclear weapons consistently for years: relationship between nuclear tested weapons & years in tests [scatter plot].
