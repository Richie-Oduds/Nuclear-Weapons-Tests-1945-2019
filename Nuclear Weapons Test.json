  "ANALYSIS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTS FROM 1945 TO 2019¶": "According to wiikipedia Nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine nuclear weapons' effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability. Testing nuclear weapons offers practical information about how the weapons function, how detonations are affected by different conditions, and how personnel, structures, and equipment are affected when subjected to nuclear explosions. However, nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength. Many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status through a nuclear test."

The dataset is reliable, original and comprehensive. The source has their own licence over the dataset. Besides that, the dataset doesn't have any personal information. All the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data. Finally, It would be good to have some updated information about the nuclear weapons tests."
